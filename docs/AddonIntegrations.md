# Addon Integrations

ConsoleExperienceClassic integrates with several popular addons to provide a seamless experience. This document describes the supported integrations and any required configuration.

## pfUI Integration

[pfUI](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI) is a full UI replacement for Vanilla WoW and TBC. ConsoleExperienceClassic provides automatic integration with pfUI.

### Automatic Features

When pfUI is detected, ConsoleExperienceClassic will:

- **Automatically disable the Chat module** - pfUI has its own chat system, so ConsoleExperience's chat module is disabled to prevent conflicts
- **Apply pfUI styling** - The ConsoleExperience configuration frame and main menu button will automatically use pfUI's styling system for a consistent look
- **Support pfUI bag frames** - Cursor navigation works seamlessly with pfUI's custom bag frames (`pfBag` and `pfBank`)

### Required Configuration

**Important:** You must manually disable the Action Bar module in pfUI to avoid conflicts with ConsoleExperience's action bars.

1. Open pfUI configuration with `/pfui`
2. Navigate to **Components** → **Action Bars**
3. Disable the Action Bar module
4. Reload your UI with `/rl`

### Benefits

- Consistent UI styling across all frames
- Full cursor navigation support for pfUI's bag system
- No chat conflicts between the two addons

### Cursor Not Appearing on Bag Frames

1. Make sure both addons are enabled
2. Try reloading your UI with `/rl`
3. Open and close the bag frame once to trigger the hook
4. Check the ConsoleExperience debug messages (if enabled) for hook status

### Conflicts with Other Addons

If you experience conflicts with other bag or UI addons:
