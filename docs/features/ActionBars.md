# Action Bars

ConsoleExperienceClassic provides a gamepad-style action bar layout designed for controller use.

## Layout

The action bar uses a "star" layout with two groups of buttons:

```
    [LT]                              [RT]
[LB] 🎮 [RB]                      [RB] 🎮 [LB]
    [A]                               [A]
    
 Left Star                        Right Star
(D-Pad + Triggers)            (Face Buttons + Triggers)
```

### Button Mapping

**Left Star (D-Pad):**
- Up, Down, Left, Right
- With LT modifier
- With LB modifier

**Right Star (Face Buttons):**
- A, B, X, Y (A defaults to Jump via System Bindings)
- With RT modifier  
- With RB modifier

> **Note:** Any button slot can be assigned to a System Binding (like Jump, Auto Run, etc.) instead of an action bar slot. See [Keybindings](../Keybindings.md) for details.

## Appearance Styles

### Classic
Traditional button style with clear borders and standard textures.

### Modern
Cleaner, more minimalist appearance.

## Customization

### Size & Position
- **Button Size**: 20-80 pixels
- **Padding**: Space between buttons in each star
- **Star Padding**: Distance between left and right star groups
- **X/Y Offset**: Position adjustment from bottom center
- **Scale**: Overall size multiplier

### Changing Layout

1. Open config with `/ce`
2. Go to "Action Bars" section
3. Adjust sliders/values
4. Changes apply immediately

## Button Prompts

The addon shows controller button icons based on your selected controller type:
- **Xbox**: A, B, X, Y, LB, RB, LT, RT
- **PlayStation**: Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle, L1, R1, L2, R2

Change this in Interface settings.

## Side Action Bars (Touch Screen)

Two optional vertical action bars designed for touch screen input. These bars have no default keybindings and are meant to be tapped directly on a touch-enabled display.

### Position
- **Left Bar**: Left edge of screen, vertically centered
- **Right Bar**: Right edge of screen, vertically centered

### Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Enable Left Side Bar | Show left touch bar | Off |
| Enable Right Side Bar | Show right touch bar | Off |
| Left Buttons (1-5) | Number of buttons on left bar | 3 |
| Right Buttons (1-5) | Number of buttons on right bar | 3 |

### Action Slots
- Left bar uses action slots 41-45
- Right bar uses action slots 46-50

### Features
- Same visual style as main action bars (button size, padding, scale)
- Supports drag & drop (Shift+click to pick up)
- Full functionality: cooldowns, range checking, usability colors
- Appears in Placement Frame when enabled for easy setup

### Use Cases
- Touch screen devices (tablets, touch monitors)
- Frequently used abilities that don't need keybinds
- Consumables, mounts, or utility spells
- Secondary rotation abilities

## Tips

- Use the placement mode to fine-tune button positions
- The right star typically holds your most-used abilities
- Modifier buttons (triggers/bumpers) give you 3x the slots per star
- Use System Bindings for common actions like Jump, Auto Run, etc.
- Side bars share size/padding settings with main action bars
